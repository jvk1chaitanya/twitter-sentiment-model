# Twitter Sentiment Classification using LSTM
This project aims to classify tweets into three different sentiments - positive, negative, and neutral. We have used an LSTM-based model for sentiment classification. The goal is to help companies analyze their customers' opinions, improve their products and services, monitor brand reputation, and predict future trends.

# Python Libraries Used
We have used various Python libraries in this project. Here's a brief overview of each library:

Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: Used for data visualization.
Beautiful Soup: Used for parsing HTML and XML documents.
NLTK: Used for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and lemmatization.
Re: Used for regular expression operations.
Tensorflow: Used for building and training deep learning models.

# Data Preprocessing
Before training the model, we need to perform some data preprocessing to remove any irrelevant data and make it suitable for our model. We have performed the following data preprocessing tasks:

Removed null values.
Removed tweets that were tagged as irrelevant.

# Text Cleaning
In natural language processing, text cleaning plays a vital role in achieving better accuracy in our model. In this project, we have defined a function called cleaned_review which is used to clean our data. The function performs the following operations:

Removes any HTML tags from the review.
Removes any URLs from the review.
Removes any non-letter characters from the review.
Converts the whole sentence to lowercase and splits the words.
Removes irrelevant words (stopwords) and lemmatizes the final output.
Tokenization and Padding
Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller chunks or tokens. In this project, we have used the Keras tokenizer to tokenize the text data. After tokenization, we pad the sequences to ensure that they are of equal length. Padding ensures that all the input sequences are of the same length, which is required for training our LSTM model.

# Splitting of Data
To evaluate our model's performance, we need to split our data into training and testing sets. In this project, we have used the train_test_split method from Scikit-learn to split our data into training and testing sets.

# Model Architecture
Our model architecture consists of the following layers:

Embedding layer: Used to convert words into dense vectors.
SpatialDropout1D layer: Used for regularization.
LSTM layer: Used for learning the sequence dependencies.
Dense layers: Used for increasing the model's capacity.
Output layer: Used to produce a probability distribution over the three classes.

# Model Training
We have trained our model using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. To prevent overfitting, we have used two techniques - model checkpoint and early stopping. The model checkpoint saves the best model during training, and the early stopping stops the training if the model's performance does not improve after a certain number of epochs. We have also used a validation step during training to evaluate the model's performance on the validation set.

# Prediction
To predict the sentiment of a new tweet, we have defined a function called "find_sentiment". This function takes a review as input, tokenizes it, and pads it to ensure that it is of the same length as the input sequences used during training. Finally, the function returns the predicted sentiment - positive, negative, or neutral.

# Conclusion
In this project, we have shown how to perform sentiment analysis on tweets using an LSTM-based model. Our model achieved an accuracy of 87.98% on the test set. This model can be used to analyze customer feedback, monitor brand reputation, predict future trends, and improve products and services accordingly.

# How models like this will be useful
Models like this can be applied to various real-world scenarios. One possible use case is in the field of market research. By analyzing the sentiment of tweets related to a particular product or service, companies can get an idea about the overall perception of their brand in the market. They can also use this information to identify specific areas for improvement, and to target marketing campaigns more effectively.

Another use case is in the field of politics. By analyzing the sentiment of tweets related to political parties or candidates, analysts can gauge the public opinion about various issues and candidates. This can be useful in predicting election outcomes, and in developing strategies for political campaigns.

In addition to these, sentiment analysis can be applied in several other fields such as customer service, brand management, public relations, and more. Overall, this sentiment classification model can help businesses and organizations make data-driven decisions, and improve their products, services, and overall reputation.
